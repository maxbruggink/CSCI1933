    //   passengers. If there's passengers who want to board and space on the
    //   ferry, then let's board. Keep track of the number of passengers that
    //   board, because we'll once again be adding another FerryEvent to allow
    //   for the time that passed, just like for deboarding.

    // If there is no deboarding and no boarding, then it's time for the ferry
    //   to move on. We'll add a new FerryEvent to the agenda, this time with
    //   the next island (remember that the ferry goes 0->1->2->0...), and the
    //   time as the amount of time it takes to travel to the next island.
